# Notifly-Desktop
Notifly is a bluetooth based messaging center for your android phone on any bluetooth enabled computer 
without the use of an external server.  It runs off a simple custom communication protocol over bluetooth 
between the phone and the computer.  It sends any incoming SMS messages directly to the computer as long 
as the connection has been enabled.  Future plans include MMS capability and Notification support.
